## Challenges Encountered

I didn’t run into any real issues while setting up or running the test. Everything — from cloning the repo to installing dependencies and running the script — worked smoothly.

## What Went Well

- Setting up the `.env` file with the API keys was straightforward
- The OpenAI response generated properly without needing retries
- The Notion page was created successfully, and the Zapier webhook returned a 200 status code

## Thoughts & Suggestions

- It would be better if the script displayed status messages for each step (e.g., "Sending to Notion...", "Webhook triggered") to make it easier to track progress or troubleshoot issues
- Better error handling would help in cases like missing API keys or failed API calls

## Notion Access Note

The Notion page was created successfully by the script, but the link is private and currently not accessible externally. I didn’t change the share settings for security reasons.

## If I Were to Improve It Further

- Turn the script into a CLI or microservice for repeatable use
- Add more robust logging to track what data is generated and where it's sent
- Optionally expand the integrations beyond Notion and Zapier
